Below is a sample 16-week course design (syllabus) in English, including Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) and a weekly breakdown that aligns with the given course description and technologies (GIT, DVC, DVC Pipeline, Google Cloud GCP, Buckets in GCP, Auto ML PyCaret, MLflow, Evidently AI, Gradio, FastAPI, Docker). 

Below is an example of how you might align each Course Learning Outcome (CLO) to one or more Program Learning Outcomes (PLO). These mappings are not strict “one-size-fits-all” rules; rather, they show a reasonable way to connect what students learn in this specific MLOps course (the CLOs) to the broader program-level outcomes (the PLOs).

### How to Use This Mapping

1. **Curriculum Design**  
   - Instructors can refer to this table to ensure each CLO supports specific PLO(s).
   - Helps in designing assessments that measure both the course-level and program-level outcomes.

2. **Assessment Planning**  
   - When creating assignments or exam questions, map each task back to the CLO–PLO alignments to ensure coverage of all desired outcomes.

3. **Program Accreditation & Review**  
   - Demonstrates evidence that individual course outcomes feed into broader program learning goals (useful for curriculum review or accreditation processes).

---

This alignment ensures that the MLOps course does not stand alone but directly contributes to the larger goals of the program, giving students clear insight into how their learning in this course maps to the skills and competencies the program aims to develop.
