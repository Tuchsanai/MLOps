|----------|-------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1        | Introduction to Git                | Learn the basics of Git, including setup, repositories, and essential commands.                   |
| 2        | Branching and Collaboration        | Understand branching, resolving merge conflicts, and using pull requests for collaboration.       |
| 3        | Advanced Git                       | Explore advanced Git features such as stashing, rebasing, undoing changes, and managing `.gitignore`. |
| 4        | Git Workflows in MLOps             | Implement Git workflows like feature branching, release management, and collaborative strategies. |
| 5        | Introduction to Google Cloud       | Explore Google Cloud services relevant to MLOps, including storage, compute, and ML tools.        |
| 6        | Introduction to DVC                | Learn how to use DVC (Data Version Control) for dataset versioning and experiment tracking.       |
| 7        | Introduction to Docker             | Learn Docker basics, including containerization concepts and writing Dockerfiles.                 |
| 8        | Docker Compose and Networking      | Build and manage multi-container applications using Docker Compose and understand networking.     |
| 9        | Docker in MLOps                    | Containerize machine learning workflows for both training and inference tasks.                    |
| 10       | Docker Orchestration               | Manage and orchestrate containerized ML workflows using tools like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.   |
| 11       | Introduction to MLflow             | Learn the components of MLflow, including experiment tracking, logging metrics, and parameters.  |
| 12       | MLflow Tracking                    | Track experiments, log custom metrics, and compare ML models using MLflow.                       |
| 13       | MLflow Models                      | Package, deploy, and serve ML models using MLflow.                                                |
| 14       | MLflow Model Registry              | Manage the model lifecycle and use MLflow Model Registry for production workflows.                |
| 15       | CI/CD in MLOps                     | Automate ML pipelines with Git and integrate MLflow for continuous integration and delivery.     |
| 16       | Mini Project                       | Apply the learned concepts to develop a complete MLOps project using Git, Docker, and MLflow.    |

### Key Improvements:
- Fixed missing rows for "Google Cloud" and "DVC."
- Standardized description phrasing and length for consistency.
- Clarified the description for tools like DVC, Google Cloud, and Docker orchestration.
- Enhanced clarity in the CI/CD and MLOps sections.
